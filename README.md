QUESTION EXTRA CREDIT 3

I've changed the 'background' property to 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)' of the '.modal-container' class. 

That way I am making the modal container transparent. This way the background won't change when navigating through the 
modal. Avoiding the background to go darker each time I change the modal window.

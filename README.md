 My fifth JavaScript Project


QUESTION EXTRA CREDIT 3

a) I've changed the 'background' property to ' background: rgba(173, 216, 230, 0.5);' (line 131) of the '.modal-container' class. 

That way I am making the modal container semi-transparent. This way the background won't change when navigating through the 
modal. Avoiding the background to go darker each time I change the modal window. 

b) margin: calc(5% + 10px) auto auto; /* Setting the modal window at the right place */ (line 139) 

I've changed the position of the modal window, so it is set in a very similar way as the mockup. 

To be more specific, I changed the position of the modal window relative to the top of the page.
